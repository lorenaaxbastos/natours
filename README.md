# Natours website

This project was undertaken during the Advanced CSS and Sass course, instructed by Jonas Schmedtmann.

### O que aprendi durante o curso?

Developing the Natours website was an incredible experience, during which I not only learned advanced CSS techniques such as animations, transitions, transformations, pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes, but also delved into complex concepts such as CSS parsing, cascade, specificity, value processing, inheritance, the visual formatting model, and more.

It was highly beneficial to delve deeper into architectures, components and BEM, as well as learning how to implement an efficient CSS workflow.

Furthermore, I gained extensive knowledge of the Sass extension, including variables, nesting, mixins, extends, and functions, in addition to utilizing NPM for package management.

Overall, it was a truly enriching experience!
